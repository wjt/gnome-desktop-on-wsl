- Install WSL
- Optional: install the most modern graphics drivers you can find (e.g. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-support-assistant.html)
- Import a rootfs generated by `create-targz.sh` in this repo:

```powershell
PS> wsl --import Bookworm $HOME\Bookworm \\path\to\install.tar.gz --version 2
```

- Start the container, and create a user. (This is normally done by the WSL distro wrapper app, but we don't have one for this demo.)

```
PS> wsl -d Bookworm
# adduser test
# adduser test adm
# adduser test sudo
# exit
```

- Log into the container as the user you just created, and start a session:

```
PS> wsl -d Bookworm -u test
$ launch-gnome
(or)
$ launch-gnome --use-wslg
```

## Credits

- `create-targz.sh` is a heavily-modified copy of the script from https://salsa.debian.org/debian/WSL, as is the `profile` in this repo.
- Many thanks to Daniel Stone for advice about WSL2 and Mesa's D3D12 driver.
